# ðŸ“© A Template to host an MTA-STS Policy file on GitHub

This repository provides a template to host your _MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)_ [[RFC 8461](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461)] policy file on GitHub Pages.

MTA-STS is a security standard to secure e-mail delivery. E-mail servers that send inbound e-mail to your domain will be able to detect that your e-mail server supports SMTP-over-TLS via `STARTTLS` (also known as [Opportunistic TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS)) before opening the actual connection.

In case the sending e-mail server is not able to initiate a secure connection, it will end the connection to enforce transport layer encryption. This mitigates [Man-in-the-middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) DNS and SMTP [downgrade attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack) that would allow an attacker to read or manipulate e-mail in transit.

## Usage

1. Click on [**Use this template**](https://github.com/jpawlowski/mta-sts.template/generate) to create a copy to your own Github profile.
   You may name your repository whatever you like. For simplicity, you can name it `mta-sts.<your_domain.tld>`.

2. Change the file `.well-known/mta-sts.txt` according to your needs.

3. Create a `CNAME` record for `mta-sts.<your_domain.tld>` in your domain's DNS that points to `<user>.github.io` or `<organization>.github.io`.
   See [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) to learn more about custom domains on GitHub Pages.

4. Open a browser to `https://mta-sts.<your_domain.tld>` and make sure it does not show any certificate warnings.

5. Create a `TXT` record for `_mta-sts.<your_domain.tld>` in your domain's DNS to enable the MTA-STS policy for your domain.
   You may copy & paste this to your DNS provider:

   ```dns
   #HOST       #TTL    #TYPE    #VALUE
   _mta-sts    3600    TXT      "v=STSv1; id=1634120459"
   ```

   Note that you will need to change the `id=` here whenever you make changes to your `mta-sts.txt` policy file.
